# Movie-Search-App-with-OMDB-API

This is a project that uses JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX to retrieve data from the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.

In this project, the client makes a GET HTTP request to retrieve data from the OMDb API, then if a valid response is received,
processes the JSON data received, rendering the search results on the screen. If no response is received, handles errors accordingly.
